# jira-chrome-extension

This is for demo purposes only. This is hardcoded to my company JIRA account url.

## How It Works

Once you install it, you can click on the button and get a browser input. You enter the JIRA issue id. You can also enter multiple id's separated by commas. Chrome then opens the JIRA issue in a new tab.

## Installation

1. Clone the repo.
2. Go to the Extensions menu in Chrome.
3. Click on the 'Load unpacked extension' button and point to the repo you just setup.
4. Check the 'Developer mode' checkbox.
5. That's it!
